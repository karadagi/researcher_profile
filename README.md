## About

Dr. Ilker Karadag is an Associate Professor of Architecture whose research lies at the intersection of machine learning, environmental analysis, and sustainable design. His work explores predictive models for airflow and microclimatic behavior, the integration of computational simulations with empirical data, and the application of these methods to bioclimatic design and cultural heritage contexts.

He holds a 2023 patent for a novel wind-analysis apparatus that enables accessible physical visualization of airflow around architectural models. In 2025, he was recognized in Stanford University’s global citation-impact rankings for his contributions to environmental simulation and architectural research.
